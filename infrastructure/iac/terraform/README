Regardless of the option you need below, first you need to use AWS CLI to create the Terraform State Bucket:



1. If you ALREADY have an applied infrastructure, and now you're ADDING DynamoDB Lock Table:

Reconfigure backend to know it must lock with DynamoDB:
terraform init -reconfigure

Create ONLY the lock table (no locking possible yet):
terraform apply -lock=false "-target=aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_locks"

Now DynamoDB exists â€” normal locking works:
terraform plan

Normal operations with lock protection from now on:
terraform apply

2. If you are STARTING a brand new infrastructure from scratch, and it ALREADY includes backend + DynamoDB lock in code:

Initialize backend (backend expects S3 + DynamoDB lock):
terraform init

Create only the DynamoDB table first without locking:
terraform apply -lock=false "-target=aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_locks"

Locking now works because table exists:
terraform plan

Normal apply with full lock protection:
terraform apply
